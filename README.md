Project : OLA - Ensemble learning
Summary: Analyze the attrition rate of drivers and understand the key factors of the attrition to enable OLA predict the likelihood of drivers leaving and innovate driver retention strategies.

Achievements
Utilized multiple ensemble techniques such as Random Forest, Gradient boost classifier and XG boost to build models and compare various metrics such as precision, recall and f1 score to find the best performing algorithm
Attained relevant actionable business insights to help reduce the driver attrition rate
Utilized visualization techniques such as matplotlib and seaborn to assist in data analysis and EDA

Tools and Techniques: Random Forest, Gradient boost, XG boost, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scaling, imputation
